# SendGrid Configuration Troubleshooting

## Current Status
- API key provided: `nULR2f9N-lfH3bBFc__lDwhih04ZGK3Ixb6B8bKAKUU`
- System is auto-prefixing with "SG." to create proper format
- Still getting 401 Unauthorized errors

## Next Steps Required

### 1. Verify SendGrid Account Setup
The API key format suggests this might be from a different email service or an incorrectly copied key. Please verify:

1. Go to https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys
2. Ensure you're logged into the correct SendGrid account
3. Create a NEW API key with these exact settings:
   - Name: "LightPrompt Production"
   - Permissions: "Full Access" 
   - Copy the complete key (should start with "SG.")

### 2. Alternative: Check if This is Another Email Service
The key format `nULR2f9N-lfH3bBFc__lDwhih04ZGK3Ixb6B8bKAKUU` doesn't match SendGrid's standard format. This might be from:
- Mailgun (typically longer alphanumeric)
- AWS SES (different format)
- Another email provider

### 3. Sender Verification Required
Even with the correct API key, SendGrid requires sender verification:
1. In SendGrid dashboard, go to Settings > Sender Authentication
2. Verify your email domain (lightprompt.co) or specific sender email
3. Complete DNS verification if using domain authentication

### 4. Testing with Verified Email
For immediate testing, you can use a verified sender email:
1. Go to Settings > Sender Authentication > Single Sender Verification
2. Add lightprompt.co@gmail.com as a verified sender
3. Check email and click verification link

## Next Actions Needed
