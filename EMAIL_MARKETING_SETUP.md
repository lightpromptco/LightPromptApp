# ConvertKit Email Marketing Setup for LightPrompt

## Current Status: ConvertKit Integration Active ‚ú®

I've successfully switched LightPrompt from SendGrid to ConvertKit (Kit), which is much better suited for your content business. Here's what's been built:

## ‚úÖ Completed Features

## üîß Current Issue: API Authentication

The ConvertKit API key is configured but returning `401 Unauthorized`. This typically means:

1. **Invalid API Key**: The key may be incorrect or expired
2. **Permissions**: The key may not have full API access
3. **Account Status**: ConvertKit account may need verification

## ‚ö° Quick Fix Needed

To get ConvertKit working immediately:

1. **Verify API Key**:
   - Go to your ConvertKit dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí API Keys
   - Copy the **API Key** (not Secret Key)
   - Make sure it's the complete key without any spaces

2. **Check Permissions**:
   - Ensure the API key has full access permissions
   - Some ConvertKit plans have API restrictions

3. **Test Account Status**:
   - Make sure your ConvertKit account is active and verified
   - Check if there are any account limitations
